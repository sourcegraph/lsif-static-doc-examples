# Package time

Package time provides functionality for measuring and displaying time. 

The calendrical calculations always assume a Gregorian calendar, with no leap seconds. 

### hdr-Monotonic_ClocksMonotonic Clocks
Operating systems provide both a “wall clock,” which is subject to changes for clock synchronization, and a “monotonic clock,” which is not. The general rule is that the wall clock is for telling time and the monotonic clock is for measuring time. Rather than split the API, in this package the Time returned by time.Now contains both a wall clock reading and a monotonic clock reading; later time-telling operations use the wall clock reading, but later time-measuring operations, specifically comparisons and subtractions, use the monotonic clock reading. 

For example, this code always computes a positive elapsed time of approximately 20 milliseconds, even if the wall clock is changed during the operation being timed: 

```
start := time.Now()
... operation that takes 20 milliseconds ...
t := time.Now()
elapsed := t.Sub(start)

```
Other idioms, such as time.Since(start), time.Until(deadline), and time.Now().Before(deadline), are similarly robust against wall clock resets. 

The rest of this section gives the precise details of how operations use monotonic clocks, but understanding those details is not required to use this package. 

The Time returned by time.Now contains a monotonic clock reading. If Time t has a monotonic clock reading, t.Add adds the same duration to both the wall clock and monotonic clock readings to compute the result. Because t.AddDate(y, m, d), t.Round(d), and t.Truncate(d) are wall time computations, they always strip any monotonic clock reading from their results. Because t.In, t.Local, and t.UTC are used for their effect on the interpretation of the wall time, they also strip any monotonic clock reading from their results. The canonical way to strip a monotonic clock reading is to use t = t.Round(0). 

If Times t and u both contain monotonic clock readings, the operations t.After(u), t.Before(u), t.Equal(u), and t.Sub(u) are carried out using the monotonic clock readings alone, ignoring the wall clock readings. If either t or u contains no monotonic clock reading, these operations fall back to using the wall clock readings. 

On some systems the monotonic clock will stop if the computer goes to sleep. On such a system, t.Sub(u) may not accurately reflect the actual time that passed between t and u. 

Because the monotonic clock reading has no meaning outside the current process, the serialized forms generated by t.GobEncode, t.MarshalBinary, t.MarshalJSON, and t.MarshalText omit the monotonic clock reading, and t.Format provides no format for it. Similarly, the constructors time.Date, time.Parse, time.ParseInLocation, and time.Unix, as well as the unmarshalers t.GobDecode, t.UnmarshalBinary. t.UnmarshalJSON, and t.UnmarshalText always create times with no monotonic clock reading. 

Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but also the Location and the monotonic clock reading. See the documentation for the Time type for a discussion of equality testing for Time values. 

For debugging, the result of t.String does include the monotonic clock reading if present. If t != u because of different monotonic clock readings, that difference will be visible when printing t.String() and u.String().

```Go
const Layout = "01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700" // The reference time, in numerical order.

```

These are predefined layouts for use in Time.Format and time.Parse. The reference time used in these layouts is the specific time stamp: 

```
01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700

```
(January 2, 15:04:05, 2006, in time zone seven hours west of GMT). That value is recorded as the constant named Layout, listed below. As a Unix time, this is 1136239445. Since MST is GMT-0700, the reference would be printed by the Unix date command as: 

```
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006

```
It is a regrettable historic error that the date uses the American convention of putting the numerical month before the day. 

The example for Time.Format demonstrates the working of the layout string in detail and is a good reference. 

Note that the RFC822, RFC850, and RFC1123 formats should be applied only to local times. Applying them to UTC times will use "UTC" as the time zone abbreviation, while strictly speaking those RFCs require the use of "GMT" in that case. In general RFC1123Z should be used instead of RFC1123 for servers that insist on that format, and RFC3339 should be preferred for new protocols. RFC3339, RFC822, RFC822Z, RFC1123, and RFC1123Z are useful for formatting; when used with time.Parse they do not accept all the time formats permitted by the RFCs and they do accept time formats not formally defined. The RFC3339Nano format removes trailing zeros from the seconds field and thus may not sort correctly once formatted. 

Most programs can use one of the defined constants as the layout passed to Format or Parse. The rest of this comment can be ignored unless you are creating a custom layout string. 

To define your own format, write down what the reference time would look like formatted your way; see the values of constants like ANSIC, StampMicro or Kitchen for examples. The model is to demonstrate what the reference time looks like so that the Format and Parse methods can apply the same transformation to a general time value. 

Here is a summary of the components of a layout string. Each element shows by example the formatting of an element of the reference time. Only these values are recognized. Text in the layout string that is not recognized as part of the reference time is echoed verbatim during Format and expected to appear verbatim in the input to Parse. 

```
Year: "2006" "06"
Month: "Jan" "January"
Textual day of the week: "Mon" "Monday"
Numeric day of the month: "2" "_2" "02"
Numeric day of the year: "__2" "002"
Hour: "15" "3" "03" (PM or AM)
Minute: "4" "04"
Second: "5" "05"
AM/PM mark: "PM"

```
Numeric time zone offsets format as follows: 

```
"-0700"  ±hhmm
"-07:00" ±hh:mm
"-07"    ±hh

```
Replacing the sign in the format with a Z triggers the ISO 8601 behavior of printing Z instead of an offset for the UTC zone. Thus: 

```
"Z0700"  Z or ±hhmm
"Z07:00" Z or ±hh:mm
"Z07"    Z or ±hh

```
Within the format string, the underscores in "_2" and "__2" represent spaces that may be replaced by digits if the following number has multiple digits, for compatibility with fixed-width Unix time formats. A leading zero represents a zero-padded value. 

The formats  and 002 are space-padded and zero-padded three-character day of year; there is no unpadded day of year format. 

A decimal point followed by one or more zeros represents a fractional second, printed to the given number of decimal places. Either a comma or decimal point followed by one or more nines represents a fractional second, printed to the given number of decimal places, with trailing zeros removed. For example "15:04:05,000" or "15:04:05.000" formats or parses with millisecond precision. 

Some valid layouts are invalid time values for time.Parse, due to formats such as _ for space padding and Z for zone information.

Within the format string, the underscores in "_2" and "__2" represent spaces that may be replaced by digits if the following number has multiple digits, for compatibility with fixed-width Unix time formats. A leading zero represents a zero-padded value. 

The formats  and 002 are space-padded and zero-padded three-character day of year; there is no unpadded day of year format. 

A decimal point followed by one or more zeros represents a fractional second, printed to the given number of decimal places. Either a comma or decimal point followed by one or more nines represents a fractional second, printed to the given number of decimal places, with trailing zeros removed. For example "15:04:05,000" or "15:04:05.000" formats or parses with millisecond precision. 

Some valid layouts are invalid time values for time.Parse, due to formats such as _ for space padding and Z for zone information.

```Go
const RFC1123 = "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST"
```

These are predefined layouts for use in Time.Format and time.Parse. The reference time used in these layouts is the specific time stamp: 

```
01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700

```
(January 2, 15:04:05, 2006, in time zone seven hours west of GMT). That value is recorded as the constant named Layout, listed below. As a Unix time, this is 1136239445. Since MST is GMT-0700, the reference would be printed by the Unix date command as: 

```
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006

```
It is a regrettable historic error that the date uses the American convention of putting the numerical month before the day. 

The example for Time.Format demonstrates the working of the layout string in detail and is a good reference. 

Note that the RFC822, RFC850, and RFC1123 formats should be applied only to local times. Applying them to UTC times will use "UTC" as the time zone abbreviation, while strictly speaking those RFCs require the use of "GMT" in that case. In general RFC1123Z should be used instead of RFC1123 for servers that insist on that format, and RFC3339 should be preferred for new protocols. RFC3339, RFC822, RFC822Z, RFC1123, and RFC1123Z are useful for formatting; when used with time.Parse they do not accept all the time formats permitted by the RFCs and they do accept time formats not formally defined. The RFC3339Nano format removes trailing zeros from the seconds field and thus may not sort correctly once formatted. 

Most programs can use one of the defined constants as the layout passed to Format or Parse. The rest of this comment can be ignored unless you are creating a custom layout string. 

To define your own format, write down what the reference time would look like formatted your way; see the values of constants like ANSIC, StampMicro or Kitchen for examples. The model is to demonstrate what the reference time looks like so that the Format and Parse methods can apply the same transformation to a general time value. 

Here is a summary of the components of a layout string. Each element shows by example the formatting of an element of the reference time. Only these values are recognized. Text in the layout string that is not recognized as part of the reference time is echoed verbatim during Format and expected to appear verbatim in the input to Parse. 

```

Month: "Jan" "January"
Textual day of the week: "Mon" "Monday"

Numeric time zone offsets format as follows: 

```
"-0700"  ±hhmm
"-07:00" ±hh:mm
"-07"    ±hh

```
Replacing the sign in the format with a Z triggers the ISO 8601 behavior of printing Z instead of an offset for the UTC zone. Thus: 

```
"Z0700"  Z or ±hhmm
"Z07:00" Z or ±hh:mm
"Z07"    Z or ±hh

```
Within the format string, the underscores in "_2" and "__2" represent spaces that may be replaced by digits if the following number has multiple digits, for compatibility with fixed-width Unix time formats. A leading zero represents a zero-padded value. 

The formats  and 002 are space-padded and zero-padded three-character day of year; there is no unpadded day of year format. 

A decimal point followed by one or more zeros represents a fractional second, printed to the given number of decimal places. Either a comma or decimal point followed by one or more nines represents a fractional second, printed to the given number of decimal places, with trailing zeros removed. For example "15:04:05,000" or "15:04:05.000" formats or parses with millisecond precision. 

Some valid layouts are invalid time values for time.Parse, due to formats such as _ for space padding and Z for zone information.

```

```Go
const StampMicro = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000000"
```

These are predefined layouts for use in Time.Format and time.Parse. The reference time used in these layouts is the specific time stamp: 

```
01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700

```
(January 2, 15:04:05, 2006, in time zone seven hours west of GMT). That value is recorded as the constant named Layout, listed below. As a Unix time, this is 1136239445. Since MST is GMT-0700, the reference would be printed by the Unix date command as: 

```
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006

```
It is a regrettable historic error that the date uses the American convention of putting the numerical month before the day. 

The example for Time.Format demonstrates the working of the layout string in detail and is a good reference. 

Note that the RFC822, RFC850, and RFC1123 formats should be applied only to local times. Applying them to UTC times will use "UTC" as the time zone abbreviation, while strictly speaking those RFCs require the use of "GMT" in that case. In general RFC1123Z should be used instead of RFC1123 for servers that insist on that format, and RFC3339 should be preferred for new protocols. RFC3339, RFC822, RFC822Z, RFC1123, and RFC1123Z are useful for formatting; when used with time.Parse they do not accept all the time formats permitted by the RFCs and they do accept time formats not formally defined. The RFC3339Nano format removes trailing zeros from the seconds field and thus may not sort correctly once formatted. 

Most programs can use one of the defined constants as the layout passed to Format or Parse. The rest of this comment can be ignored unless you are creating a custom layout string. 

To define your own format, write down what the reference time would look like formatted your way; see the values of constants like ANSIC, StampMicro or Kitchen for examples. The model is to demonstrate what the reference time looks like so that the Format and Parse methods can apply the same transformation to a general time value. 

Here is a summary of the components of a layout string. Each element shows by example the formatting of an element of the reference time. Only these values are recognized. Text in the layout string that is not recognized as part of the reference time is echoed verbatim during Format and expected to appear verbatim in the input to Parse. 

```

Month: "Jan" "January"
Textual day of the week: "Mon" "Monday"
Numeric day of the month: "2" "_2" "02"

Common durations. There is no definition for units of Day or larger to avoid confusion across daylight savings time zone transitions. 

To count the number of units in a Duration, divide:

The Timer type represents a single event. When the Timer expires, the current time will be sent on C, unless the Timer was created by AfterFunc. A Timer must be created with NewTimer or AfterFunc. 

#### <a id="NewTimer" href="#NewTimer">func NewTimer(d Duration) *Timer</a>

```
searchKey: time.AfterFunc
tags: [exported]
```

```Go
func AfterFunc(d Duration, f func()) *Timer
```

AfterFunc waits for the duration to elapse and then calls f in its own goroutine. It returns a Timer that can be used to cancel the call using its Stop method. 

#### <a id="Timer.Stop" href="#Timer.Stop">func (t *Timer) Stop() bool</a>

```
searchKey: time.Timer.Stop
tags: [exported]
```

```Go
func (t *Timer) Stop() bool
```

Stop prevents the Timer from firing. It returns true if the call stops the timer, false if the timer has already expired or been stopped. Stop does not close the channel, to prevent a read from the channel succeeding incorrectly. 

To ensure the channel is empty after a call to Stop, check the return value and drain the channel. For example, assuming the program has not received from t.C already: 

```
if !t.Stop() {
	<-t.C
}

```
This cannot be done concurrent to other receives from the Timer's channel or other calls to the Timer's Stop method. 

For a timer created with AfterFunc(d, f), if t.Stop returns false, then the timer has already expired and the function f has been started in its own goroutine; Stop does not wait for f to complete before returning. If the caller needs to know whether f is completed, it must coordinate with f explicitly. 

#### <a id="Timer.Reset" href="#Timer.Reset">func (t *Timer) Reset(d Duration) bool</a>

```
searchKey: time.Timer.Reset
tags: [exported]
```

```Go
func (t *Timer) Reset(d Duration) bool
```

Reset changes the timer to expire after duration d. It returns true if the timer had been active, false if the timer had expired or been stopped. 

For a Timer created with NewTimer, Reset should be invoked only on stopped or expired timers with drained channels. 

If a program has already received a value from t.C, the timer is known to have expired and the channel drained, so t.Reset can be used directly. If a program has not yet received a value from t.C, however, the timer must be stopped and—if Stop reports that the timer expired before being stopped—the channel explicitly drained: 

```
if !t.Stop() {
	<-t.C
}
t.Reset(d)

```
This should not be done concurrent to other receives from the Timer's channel. 

Note that it is not possible to use Reset's return value correctly, as there is a race condition between draining the channel and the new timer expiring. Reset should always be invoked on stopped or expired channels, as described above. The return value exists to preserve compatibility with existing programs. 

For a Timer created with AfterFunc(d, f), Reset either reschedules when f will run, in which case Reset returns true, or schedules f to run again, in which case it returns false. When Reset returns false, Reset neither waits for the prior f to complete before returning nor does it guarantee that the subsequent goroutine running f does not run concurrently with the prior one. If the caller needs to know whether the prior execution of f is completed, it must coordinate with f explicitly.

NewTicker returns a new Ticker containing a channel that will send the time on the channel after each tick. The period of the ticks is specified by the duration argument. The ticker will adjust the time interval or drop ticks to make up for slow receivers. The duration d must be greater than zero; if not, NewTicker will panic. Stop the ticker to release associated resources.

Stop turns off a ticker. After Stop, no more ticks will be sent. Stop does not close the channel, to prevent a concurrent goroutine reading from the channel from seeing an erroneous "tick".

	// All UTC times are represented with loc==nil, never loc==&utcLoc.
	loc *Location
}
```

A Time represents an instant in time with nanosecond precision. 

Programs using times should typically store and pass them as values, not pointers. That is, time variables and struct fields should be of type time.Time, not *time.Time. 

A Time value can be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously except that the methods GobDecode, UnmarshalBinary, UnmarshalJSON and UnmarshalText are not concurrency-safe. 

Time instants can be compared using the Before, After, and Equal methods. The Sub method subtracts two instants, producing a Duration. The Add method adds a Time and a Duration, producing a Time. 

The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000 UTC. As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the IsZero method gives a simple way of detecting a time that has not been initialized explicitly. 

Each Time has associated with it a Location, consulted when computing the presentation form of the time, such as in the Format, Hour, and Year methods. The methods Local, UTC, and In return a Time with a specific location. Changing the location in this way changes only the presentation; it does not change the instant in time being denoted and therefore does not affect the computations described in earlier paragraphs. 

Representations of a Time value saved by the GobEncode, MarshalBinary, MarshalJSON, and MarshalText methods store the Time.Location's offset, but not the location name. They therefore lose information about Daylight Saving Time. 

In addition to the required “wall clock” reading, a Time may contain an optional reading of the current process's monotonic clock, to provide additional precision for comparison or subtraction. See the “Monotonic Clocks” section in the package documentation for details. 

Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but also the Location and the monotonic clock reading. Therefore, Time values should not be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing that the identical Location has been set for all values, which can be achieved through use of the UTC or Local method, and that the monotonic clock reading has been stripped by setting t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer t.Equal(u) to t == u, since t.Equal uses the most accurate comparison available and correctly handles the case when only one of its arguments has a monotonic clock reading. 

#### <a id="Parse" href="#Parse">func Parse(layout, value string) (Time, error)</a>

```
searchKey: time.Parse
tags: [exported]
```

```Go
func Parse(layout, value string) (Time, error)
```

Parse parses a formatted string and returns the time value it represents. See the documentation for the constant called Layout to see how to represent the format. The second argument must be parseable using the format string (layout) provided as the first argument. 

The example for Time.Format demonstrates the working of the layout string in detail and is a good reference. 

When parsing (only), the input may contain a fractional second field immediately after the seconds field, even if the layout does not signify its presence. In that case either a comma or a decimal point followed by a maximal series of digits is parsed as a fractional second. 

Elements omitted from the layout are assumed to be zero or, when zero is impossible, one, so parsing "3:04pm" returns the time corresponding to Jan 1, year 0, 15:04:00 UTC (note that because the year is 0, this time is before the zero Time). Years must be in the range 0000..9999. The day of the week is checked for syntax but it is otherwise ignored. 

For layouts specifying the two-digit year 06, a value NN >= 69 will be treated as 19NN and a value NN < 69 will be treated as 20NN. 

The remainder of this comment describes the handling of time zones. 

In the absence of a time zone indicator, Parse returns a time in UTC. 

When parsing a time with a zone offset like -0700, if the offset corresponds to a time zone used by the current location (Local), then Parse uses that location and zone in the returned time. Otherwise it records the time as being in a fabricated location with time fixed at the given zone offset. 

When parsing a time with a zone abbreviation like MST, if the zone abbreviation has a defined offset in the current location, then that offset is used. The zone abbreviation "UTC" is recognized as UTC regardless of location. If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records the time as being in a fabricated location with the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset. This choice means that such a time can be parsed and reformatted with the same layout losslessly, but the exact instant used in the representation will differ by the actual zone offset. To avoid such problems, prefer time layouts that use a numeric zone offset, or use ParseInLocation.

```
searchKey: time.ParseInLocation

```

```Go
func ParseInLocation(layout, value string, loc *Location) (Time, error)
```

ParseInLocation is like Parse but differs in two important ways. First, in the absence of time zone information, Parse interprets a time as UTC; ParseInLocation interprets the time as in the given location. Second, when given a zone offset or abbreviation, Parse tries to match it against the Local location; ParseInLocation uses the given location.

```Go
func Date(year int, month Month, day, hour, min, sec, nsec int, loc *Location) Time
```

Date returns the Time corresponding to 

```
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss + nsec nanoseconds

```
in the appropriate zone for that time in the given location. 

The month, day, hour, min, sec, and nsec values may be outside their usual ranges and will be normalized during the conversion. For example, October 32 converts to November 1. 

A daylight savings time transition skips or repeats times. For example, in the United States, March 13, 2011 2:15am never occurred, while November 6, 2011 1:15am occurred twice. In such cases, the choice of time zone, and therefore the time, is not well-defined. Date returns a time that is correct in one of the two zones involved in the transition, but it does not guarantee which. 

Date panics if loc is nil.

```

LoadLocation returns the Location with the given name. 

If the name is "" or "UTC", LoadLocation returns UTC. If the name is "Local", LoadLocation returns Local. 

Otherwise, the name is taken to be a location name corresponding to a file in the IANA Time Zone database, such as "America/New_York". 

The time zone database needed by LoadLocation may not be present on all systems, especially non-Unix systems. LoadLocation looks in the directory or uncompressed zip file named by the ZONEINFO environment variable, if any, then looks in known installation locations on Unix systems, and finally looks in $GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip.

func (l *Location) lookup(sec int64) (name string, offset int, start, end int64, isDST bool)
```

lookup returns information about the time zone in use at an instant in time expressed as seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. 

The returned information gives the name of the zone (such as "CET"), the start and end times bracketing sec when that zone is in effect, the offset in seconds east of UTC (such as -5*60*60), and whether the daylight savings is being observed at that time.

The reference implementation in localtime.c from [https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/releases/tzcode2013g.tar.gz](https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/releases/tzcode2013g.tar.gz) implements the following algorithm for these cases: 1) If the first zone is unused by the transitions, use it. 2) Otherwise, if there are transition times, and the first 

```
transition is to a zone in daylight time, find the first
non-daylight-time zone before and closest to the first transition

```
searchKey: time.parseTimeZone
```

```Go
func parseTimeZone(value string) (length int, ok bool)
```

parseTimeZone parses a time zone string and returns its length. Time zones are human-generated and unpredictable. We can't do precise error checking. On the other hand, for a correct parse there must be a time zone at the beginning of the string, so it's almost always true that there's one there. We look at the beginning of the string for a run of upper-case letters. If there are more than 5, it's an error. If there are 4 or 5 and the last is a T, it's a time zone. If there are 3, it's a time zone. Otherwise, other than special cases, it's not a time zone. GMT is special because it can have an hour offset. 

### <a id="parseGMT" href="#parseGMT">func parseGMT(value string) int</a>

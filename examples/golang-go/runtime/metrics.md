# Package metrics

Package metrics provides a stable interface to access implementation-defined metrics exported by the Go runtime. This package is similar to existing functions like runtime.ReadMemStats and debug.ReadGCStats, but significantly more general. 

The set of metrics defined by this package may evolve as the runtime itself evolves, and also enables variation across Go implementations, whose relevant metric sets may not intersect. 

### hdr-InterfaceInterface
Metrics are designated by a string key, rather than, for example, a field name in a struct. The full list of supported metrics is always available in the slice of Descriptions returned by All. Each Description also includes useful information about the metric. 

Thus, users of this API are encouraged to sample supported metrics defined by the slice returned by All to remain compatible across Go versions. Of course, situations arise where reading specific metrics is critical. For these cases, users are encouraged to use build tags, and although metrics may be deprecated and removed, users should consider this to be an exceptional and rare event, coinciding with a very large change in a particular Go implementation. 

Each metric key also has a "kind" that describes the format of the metric's value. In the interest of not breaking users of this package, the "kind" for a given metric is guaranteed not to change. If it must change, then a new metric will be introduced with a new key and a new "kind." 

### hdr-Metric_key_formatMetric key format
As mentioned earlier, metric keys are strings. Their format is simple and well-defined, designed to be both human and machine readable. It is split into two components, separated by a colon: a rooted path and a unit. The choice to include the unit in the key is motivated by compatibility: if a metric's unit changes, its semantics likely did also, and a new key should be introduced. 

For more details on the precise definition of the metric key's path and unit formats, see the documentation of the Name field of the Description struct. 

### hdr-A_note_about_floatsA note about floats
This package supports metrics whose values have a floating-point representation. In order to improve ease-of-use, this package promises to never produce the following classes of floating-point values: NaN, infinity. 

### hdr-Supported_metricsSupported metrics
Below is the full list of supported metrics, ordered lexicographically. 

```
/gc/cycles/automatic:gc-cycles
	Count of completed GC cycles generated by the Go runtime.

/gc/cycles/forced:gc-cycles
	Count of completed GC cycles forced by the application.

/gc/cycles/total:gc-cycles
	Count of all completed GC cycles.

/gc/heap/allocs-by-size:bytes
	Distribution of heap allocations by approximate size.
	Note that this does not include tiny objects as defined by /gc/heap/tiny/allocs:objects,
	only tiny blocks.

/gc/heap/allocs:bytes
	Cumulative sum of memory allocated to the heap by the application.

/gc/heap/allocs:objects
	Cumulative count of heap allocations triggered by the application.
	Note that this does not include tiny objects as defined by /gc/heap/tiny/allocs:objects,
	only tiny blocks.

/gc/heap/frees-by-size:bytes
	Distribution of freed heap allocations by approximate size.
	Note that this does not include tiny objects as defined by /gc/heap/tiny/allocs:objects,
	only tiny blocks.

/gc/heap/frees:bytes
	Cumulative sum of heap memory freed by the garbage collector.

/gc/heap/frees:objects
	Cumulative count of heap allocations whose storage was freed by the garbage collector.
	Note that this does not include tiny objects as defined by /gc/heap/tiny/allocs:objects,
	only tiny blocks.

/gc/heap/goal:bytes
	Heap size target for the end of the GC cycle.

/gc/heap/objects:objects
	Number of objects, live or unswept, occupying heap memory.

/gc/heap/tiny/allocs:objects
	Count of small allocations that are packed together into blocks.
	These allocations are counted separately from other allocations
	because each individual allocation is not tracked by the runtime,
	only their block. Each block is already accounted for in
	allocs-by-size and frees-by-size.

/gc/pauses:seconds
	Distribution individual GC-related stop-the-world pause latencies.

/memory/classes/heap/free:bytes

	Memory occupied by live objects and dead objects that have
	not yet been marked free by the garbage collector.

/memory/classes/heap/released:bytes
	Memory that is completely free and has been returned to

	free address space that is still mapped into the process, but
	is not backed by physical memory.

/memory/classes/heap/stacks:bytes
	Memory allocated from the heap that is reserved for stack
	space, whether or not it is currently in-use.

	Memory that is used by the stack trace hash map used for
	profiling.

/memory/classes/total:bytes

	// Name is the full name of the metric which includes the unit.
	//
	// The format of the metric may be described by the following regular expression.
	//
	// 	^(?P<name>/[^:]+):(?P<unit>[^:*/]+(?:[*/][^:*/]+)*)$
	//
	// The format splits the name into two components, separated by a colon: a path which always
	// starts with a /, and a machine-parseable unit. The name may contain any valid Unicode
	// codepoint in between / characters, but by convention will try to stick to lowercase
	// characters and hyphens. An example of such a path might be "/memory/heap/free".
	//
	// The unit is by convention a series of lowercase English unit names (singular or plural)
	// without prefixes delimited by '*' or '/'. The unit names may contain any valid Unicode
	// codepoint that is not a delimiter.
	// Examples of units might be "seconds", "bytes", "bytes/second", "cpu-seconds",
	// "byte*cpu-seconds", and "bytes/second/second".
	//
	// For histograms, multiple units may apply. For instance, the units of the buckets and
	// the count. By convention, for histograms, the units of the count are always "samples"
	// with the type of sample evident by the metric's name, while the unit in the name
	// specifies the buckets' unit.
	//
	// A complete name might look like "/memory/heap/free:bytes".
	Name string

	// Description is an English language sentence describing the metric.

	Kind ValueKind

	// Cumulative is whether or not the metric is cumulative. If a cumulative metric is just
	// a single number, then it increases monotonically. If the metric is a distribution,
	// then each bucket count increases monotonically.
	//
	// This flag thus indicates whether or not it's useful to compute a rate from this value.
	Cumulative bool

Description describes a runtime metric. 

### <a id="Float64Histogram" href="#Float64Histogram">type Float64Histogram struct</a>

```

```Go
type Float64Histogram struct {
	// Counts contains the weights for each histogram bucket.
	//
	// Given N buckets, Count[n] is the weight of the range
	// [bucket[n], bucket[n+1]), for 0 <= n < N.
	Counts []uint64

	// Buckets contains the boundaries of the histogram buckets, in increasing order.
	//
	// Buckets[0] is the inclusive lower bound of the minimum bucket while
	// Buckets[len(Buckets)-1] is the exclusive upper bound of the maximum bucket.
	// Hence, there are len(Buckets)-1 counts. Furthermore, len(Buckets) != 1, always,
	// since at least two boundaries are required to describe one bucket (and 0
	// boundaries are used to describe 0 buckets).
	//
	// Buckets[0] is permitted to have value -Inf and Buckets[len(Buckets)-1] is
	// permitted to have value Inf.
	//
	// For a given metric name, the value of Buckets is guaranteed not to change
	// between calls until program exit.
	//
	// This slice value is permitted to alias with other Float64Histograms' Buckets
	// fields, so the values within should only ever be read. If they need to be
	// modified, the user must make a copy.
	Buckets []float64

### <a id="Read" href="#Read">func Read(m []Sample)</a>

```
searchKey: metrics.Read
tags: [exported]
```

```Go
func Read(m []Sample)
```

Read populates each Value field in the given slice of metric samples. 

Desired metrics should be present in the slice with the appropriate name. The user of this API is encouraged to re-use the same slice between calls for efficiency, but is not required to do so. 

Note that re-use has some caveats. Notably, Values should not be read or manipulated while a Read with that value is outstanding; that is a data race. This property includes pointer-typed Values (for example, Float64Histogram) whose underlying storage will be reused by Read when possible. To safely use such values in a concurrent setting, all data must be deep-copied. 

It is safe to execute multiple Read calls concurrently, but their arguments must share no underlying memory. When in doubt, create a new []Sample from scratch, which is always safe, though may be inefficient. 

Sample values with names not appearing in All will have their Value populated as KindBad to indicate that the name is unknown.
